# azure-sophos-xg
Deployment template to deploy Sophos XG firewall to Azure.

Mirrored source (https://github.com/sophos-iaas/xg-azure/) and confirmed working. Will make later versions not create an unused availbility set and also set static private IPs on NICs.

Deploying
=========

1.) Open template link: https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FNorm-Reeves%2Fazure-sophos-xg%2F1.0%2FmainTemplate.json

2.) Upload (and modify if needed) parameters.json. Take a look on the example values for template parameters in `mainTemplateParameters.json`.

Please note:
* The `adminPassword` has to be minimum 8 characters, **containing at least a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, a number, and a special character.**

3) Deployment will start.
4) Wait until the deployment goes to state "Succeeded".
